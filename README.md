# Sum_score_validation_in_survey
Regardless of the number of questions, this methodology is used to sum up item scores to become a total score.
Step 1: Define query by a subset of data elements due to limited number of DEs that can be queried at the same time
Step 2: Aggregate all associated data elements into one place (Be very cautious about this step. Recommend use Query Tool results to make sure you donâ€™t mismatch these pieces of information)
Step 3: Apply the calculation rules for each sum score.
Step 4: Compare to the submitted total to recommend whether or not there are wrong data.
